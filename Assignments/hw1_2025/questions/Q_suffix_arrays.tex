{\bf [25 points] Pattern Searches with Suffix Trees}\\

\vspace{0.1in}



\begin{itemize}
 

    \item Draw the suffix tree for the following string. Include at least 3 of the suffix links. \\
    S = GCCACCGGCCACCC

    \begin{solution}
    Add your solution here.
    \end{solution}

    \item Describe an O(n) time algorithm that will find the longest substring that is both a prefix and suffix of S.

    \begin{solution}
    Add your solution here.
    \end{solution}
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    
    \item Describe an O(n) time algorithm that will return the number of times a pattern P occurs in S. Hint: Tree traversal methods such as DFS and BFS run in O(n + m) time, where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of edges.
